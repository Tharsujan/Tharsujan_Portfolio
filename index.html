        <h2>Full Stack Developer</h2>
        <p>I'm a full-stack developer with a love for creating websites and apps. I know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building websites that look great and work well. I use React.js for making interactive web pages, and Node.js with Express.js for handling the behind-the-scenes stuff. I'm also good with databases like MongoDB and MySQL for storing information securely.

          I'm not just about websites though - I also enjoy making mobile apps. I use Flutter and Firebase to create apps that work on both iPhones and Android phones. I know Dart, which helps me write code for these apps.
          
          Besides, I'm familiar with programming languages like C, Java, and PHP, which helps me solve problems and build cool stuff. I'm always learning and improving, and I'm ready to bring my skills to any project!</p>
